## Introduction
 Predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## The Data
**train.csv:** personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.

**test.csv:** personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.
